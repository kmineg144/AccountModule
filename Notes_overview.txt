objective: 
identify big target customers and assign account managers 
- account volume is too big
- customer upgraded over time
- initial sales by EAE (6 or 12 mo) hand off to account manager (some politics)

billing address - main key
if it is outside the region, use a majority rule 


under $500 spending, no account manager


SQL couldn't handle OR statements -- no index 

NDW migration ?  

SQL Server update SET (many)
Teradata - watch out for multiple value updates 


family_id 
- originally generated in SAS (table -> table with family_id and merge)
- need to keep the old ids
-

athena data -- tricky
