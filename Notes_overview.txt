Stakeholders - Regions

Sales - director/sn manager etc. 
Davon O'Leary

objective: 
identify big target customers and assign account managers 
- account volume is too big
- customer upgraded over time
- initial sales by EAE (6 or 12 mo) hand off to account manager (some politics)

billing address - main key
if it is outside the region, use a majority rule 


under $500 spending, no account manager is needed 


SQL couldn't handle OR statements -- no index 

NDW migration ?  

SQL Server update SET (many)
Teradata - watch out for multiple value updates 


family_id 
- originally generated in SAS (table -> table with family_id and merge)
- may need to keep the old ids
 


SQL code mostly inherited from Leon 
python code from David

2019 Leon started it
late 2019  David stared working on this, then shelved
July 2020  David worked on it


single view, csg data -- relatively easy

athena data -- tricky 
- business id, hq_id  -- supplemental business identification 
- other info about businesses 
- info from other companies enter 
- Comcast doesn't own the data source and someone outside can change it

salesforce -- tricky
- data input duplicates exist 
	- making rules 
		most recent closed opp
		might miss national accounts
		potentially franchise   



externaluser.[SingleView].[GLDetail_Data_Monthly_Enhanced]
- contain only active accounts

[ExternalUser].[NDW].[BC_SUBS_JV]
- main cgs 

take care of intersection between SV and CSG  -- look at FILE_GROUP
- get SV-only customers  
- get SV-CSG customers AAN
- CSG-only customers -- rare by the end of all filtering 


salesforce data
- account number may be in any of various columns 
- coudn't find matching salesforce accoutns for about 6% 


SV 
- enterprise level products 
- generally higher MRC - monthly recurring charge  

CSG
- coax products 
- often more simple products 


SVM - root account number in SV
SVAN - account number in SV

Vantage data
- gives MRC of Connection Pro and WiFi Pro type products 

----------------------------------------------------------------


line 102 400k rows after filtering line 360k rows ?  -- should be smaller 

line 426 CSG-only customers -- relatively rare but include them? 

line 429 why set FAMILY_ID to 111..111? 


line 621 what does this mean?  CSG4 in ('8155','8777','8497','8498','8772','8778','8495','8512')
first 4 location -  west?

line 716 where does MOD_BUSN_ID come from?
alias 

line 844 where did you generate a table you gave to Ram? 
- see email  RPTCB.RPT.SCA_MODULE_FAMILY_ID_SAS_DYAO_11_2020

line 847 what happens to FAMILY_ID != 0 ?  
probably not needed 

line 853 what does 'CSG^SV' mean? what is this trying to do? 
- not sure ask Leon


line 882 MAXHQIDFORFAMILY what is this used for?  replacing region to null? 
- check later, why replacing substring with blank just for a subset 

line 904 CSG_FAMILY_ID_REGIONFIX similar? 
- something to do with adjusting region 
line 926 CKFAMHQREGION? 
 
- CSG region exists, SV get it from elsewhere

line 948  are CSG_BUSN_NAME and SV_ROOT_ACCOUNT_NAME reliable to identify distinct businesses without poooling some that happen to have the same names?
- CSG_BUSN_NAME -string but unique and SV_ROOT_ACCOUNT_NAME -string but unique
- when do we want the same family_id for multiple locations within a company? trust billing info.
- 

line 52 which accounts are pulled and inserted?


sfdc
use SobjectType to filter out junk rows
several columns to hold account numbers csg  CSG_Account_Number__c, sv Parent_BAN__c
account data -first, 
order data - linked with billing?, automatic which may capture accounts that may be missing in account data, 
location_lookup - another data


SQL server has a timeout limit
- watch out for gather_all_sfdc_info 


- it takes time to modify and run 
- no loop
- select all data you need and do all ETL in python
- ask Aaron 
- salesforce data, bc_sub -- in Teradata
- sv   



family_id 
- temporary id 
- used to determine overlap 
- logic is up to the person in charge: Leon -> David -> Kota/Aaron

- create new logic for family id
- salesforce parent_id, any hireachical correlation from salesforce
- billing system (SV, CSG): same name = same account
- SV multi-tier 
- CSG listed within SV
- athena all sorts of data + legal association, athna_business_id, HQ_ID

- use existing account_onwer:  
    - AM_Module__c not null  
    - CAGE_Number__c (teritory) not null 
    - OwnerID not null

- Brad Lopez - created AM_Module__c and CAGE_Number__c created for this project

- Ask Devon (primary stakeholder) what the excat objective is and what they need. how best to achieve this.
