Databases in WESTBIS: 
- EXTERNALUSER.SingleView 
- EXTERNALUSER.MIP (Athena data)
- EXTERNALUSER.NDW
- EXTERNALUSER.SFDC
- EXTERNALUSER.VANTAGE

Need access to RPTCB.RPT to write tables. 


biller_athena.sql
- This query generates all the active businesses in SV and CSG. Additionally, it tries to find SV accounts also with CSG accounts 
- It does some preliminary filtering (ie national accounts, Gov-ed accounts) based on SV and CSG data
- There is some aggregation done  (summing up their entire bill) to combine multiple rows into one for a given account.
- It also tries to link Athena data (BUSINESS_ID and HQ_ID) to the account using the product_instance_id


gather_all_sfdc_info.sql
- Intuition behind this was to gather all the SFDC data all at once and then join it with the Biller/Athena output from above
- After running this, you will have an SFDC account number with 1 or more Biller ID to tie the two data sets to


sfdc_accounts_to_biller.sql
- This goes through the two scripts above and joins biller data with the SF data
- Since there are multiple columns to join on, we repeat the steps multiple times
- Note: I tried to shorten the script by using OR statement to combine JOINS but the script would constantly time out before finishing
- generates two files you will need for the python script
- account level SFDC data
- opportunity level SFDC data
- FYI: opportunity ïƒ  account level. You start from the opportunity level data which rolls up to account level information. For example: 2 opportunities : ABC and DEF both roll up to account: XYZ




sfdc_to_biller_athena.sql
- This script is meant to connect Athena data with SF. 
- It is mainly used to give us the summary output next

summary.sql
- summary takes the output from sfdc_to_biller_athena.sql and summarizes the data by performing row level aggregations
- spits out the final output for python to perform ETL on.
- Get output by running: 
- select * from BI_MIP.dbo.biller_sfdc_accounts_summary_dyao  order by family_id
